:::warning Breaking changes
If you do have existing favourites and menus they are not compatible with version 2. I recommend Creating a new v2 site to host. I am working on a Flow to upgrade them for the final v2 release.

Welcome to version 2 of the Icon Menu Builder, when you first load the app and don't have any favourites saved you will see the credits screen.

### Main Menu

The main menu is a 2 level menu, links with a chevron will open to show more icons...
