:::warning Breaking changes
If you do have existing favourites and menus they are not compatible with version 2. I recommend Creating a new v2 site to host. I am working on a Flow to upgrade them for the final v2 release.

Welcome to version 2 of the Icon Menu Builder, when you first load the app and don't have any favourites saved you will see the credits screen.

## Home Screen

Using Gestalt design principles the screen is split into 4 areas:

1. Main Menu
2. Browser 
3. Selected Icon and Settings panel and
4. Menu Builder
