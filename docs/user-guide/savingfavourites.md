## Removing Favourites

:::caution
Deleting a favourite will immediately delete the icon from the SharePoint List __My Favourites__ there is no warning or confirmation, for me it was an unnecessary click and unneccesary controls.


You can remove a favourite in two places, first on the __My Favourites__ page:

![Remove Favourite](../assets/delete-fav-myfav-screen.gif)

and you can remove a favourite from the icons browser click on the __Remove from Favourites__ ❤️ Icon
